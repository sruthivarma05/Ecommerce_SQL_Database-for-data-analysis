# Ecommerce_SQL_Database-for-data-analysis
This project demonstrates SQL for data analysis using an e-commerce dataset. It includes queries with filtering, joins, subqueries, aggregates, views, and indexes to extract insights and optimize performance.
This project is focused on learning how to use SQL for data analysis in a practical, real-world way. I designed and worked with a simple e-commerce database containing two core tables: one for Customers and another for Orders. These tables simulate a business environment where customer information and their purchase histories are stored.

The main goal of the project was to go beyond just storing data and actually extract meaningful insights from it. Using SQL, I was able to write queries that answered useful business questions such as which customers are from a specific city, who the top-spending customers are, how many orders each customer placed along with their average spend, and which customers made purchases above a certain value.

To achieve this, I explored a wide range of SQL features. With filtering and sorting through SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY, I narrowed down results and presented them in a clear, organized format. Aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT were applied with GROUP BY to calculate total spend per customer, average order value, and order frequency. Joins including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN allowed me to combine customer details with their orders, giving a fuller picture of customer behavior. Subqueries were used to answer more specific questions, like identifying customers who made purchases above a certain threshold. I also created a view called CustomerOrderSummary so recurring reports such as customer spending summaries could be generated easily without rewriting the same queries. To improve performance, indexes were added on frequently queried columns, ensuring faster lookups when analyzing larger datasets.

 Outcome

By completing this project, I reinforced my knowledge of SQL syntax and gained a deeper understanding of how databases are used in real business scenarios. The process showed how raw tables of customer and order data can be transformed into actionable insights that support decision-making.

For example, identifying the top-spending customers, understanding city-wise purchase trends, and calculating average order sizes are all insights that could directly guide marketing or sales strategies in an actual e-commerce company.

Most importantly, the project helped me practice end-to-end SQL skills including creating tables, inserting and managing data, writing analytical queries, optimizing performance, and presenting results clearly. These are the same skills needed by data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and backend engineers in their daily work.
